# buffinfo.pabgb reverse-engineering notes

Working notes for the multi-session task of building a Phase 3+
buffinfo body decoder so field-names dialect Format 3 mods (e.g.
Double Resource Buff, Nexus 2276) that target
``buff_data_list[i].data.base.{...}`` can apply.

## Verified so far (Phases 1 + 2, shipped)

```
[0..3]            entry_key                 (u32 LE)
[4..7]            slen                      (u32 LE)
[8..7+slen]       name                      (UTF-8)
[prefix_end]      _isBlocked tag/value      (1 byte; always 0 in v1.05)
[prefix_end+1..]  _buffDataList count       (u32; 1..200 observed)
[body_start..]    _buffDataList items       (NOT decoded yet)
```

Source: 280 entries from CD v1.05 vanilla buffinfo.pabgb (extracted
via pycrimson's BinaryGameBlob + the matching .pabgh header).

## Unverified (next session)

The bytes from ``body_start`` onward look like a sequence of
tagged-primitive blocks. From inspection of single-item
(``_buffDataList`` count = 1) entries, the apparent shape is:

```
body_start +0..+14   (15 bytes)   _isBlocked-like field:
                                   (u32, byte, u32, byte, u32, byte)
                                   where the u32s vary across entries
                                   and the bytes are always 0x00.
                                   Engine schema lists this as
                                   direct_15B which matches.

body_start +15..+18  (4 bytes)    _maxLevel  (u32 LE)
body_start +19..+22  (4 bytes)    _minLevel  (u32 LE)

body_start +23..+37  (15 bytes)   _buffLevelCalculateType
                                   direct_15B, same shape as
                                   _isBlocked

body_start +38?..    ??           Cross-check failed: in the
                                   BuffLevel_Comma_Symptom oracle,
                                   the next field's u32 length
                                   prefix lands at offset 75 within
                                   the entry (body_start + 39, NOT
                                   +38). One byte off vs the schema
                                   sum of 15+4+4+15 = 38. Could be:
                                   * A trailing 0x00 separator byte
                                     after _buffLevelCalculateType
                                   * Or _isBlocked is actually 16
                                     bytes not 15
                                   * Or there's a hidden field
                                     between _buffLevelCalculateType
                                     and _sequencerFileName that the
                                     engine schema doesn't list.

                                   Need an oracle (run a known-good
                                   external tool on the same input,
                                   observe which bytes change) to
                                   disambiguate.
```

## Open question: are buff_data items here at all?

Hypothesis A: buff_data items begin AT ``body_start``, with what
I'm reading as ``_isBlocked / _maxLevel / _minLevel`` actually being
the FIRST item's per-item fields (e.g. ``absent_flag`` /
``some_count`` / ``level_id``).

Hypothesis B: buff_data items begin AFTER the
``_isBlocked..._sequencerFileName`` fields, somewhere in the 100+
remaining bytes.

The path ``buff_data_list[0].data.base.absent_flag`` from Adfaz's
mod targets ``absent_flag`` of the first item. Once we can produce
a parser that emits the offset of a known field for a known entry,
running Adfaz's mod through CDUMM's apply path with verbose logging
on a SINGLE intent should let us reverse the offset.

## Tooling already in place

* ``BuffinfoEntryHeader`` returns offsets for ``is_blocked_offset``,
  ``buff_data_count_offset``, and ``body_start``. Future fields
  should also expose ``_offset`` annotations in the same shape as
  ``characterinfo_full_parser.py``.

* ``locate_buff_field(entry_bytes, field_path)`` is the eventual
  public API. Currently returns ``None`` for everything. Each new
  field decoded should add a branch returning
  ``(offset, width, dtype)``.

## Additional findings (Session 2)

### Engine schema for BuffInfo has 13 fields total

Pulled from ``schemas/pabgb_complete_schema.json``. In declaration
order:

| # | Field | type | size |
|---|-------|------|------|
| 1 | _stringKey | (cstring) | variable |
| 2 | _key | direct_u32 | 4 |
| 3 | _buffDataList | direct_u32 | 4 (count only , items live elsewhere) |
| 4 | _isBlocked | direct_15B | 15 |
| 5 | _maxLevel | direct_u32 | 4 |
| 6 | _minLevel | direct_u32 | 4 |
| 7 | _buffLevelCalculateType | direct_15B | 15 |
| 8 | _sequencerFileName | (cstring) | variable |
| 9 | _uiComponentName | reader_4B | 4 |
| 10 | _uiTemplateName | reader_4B | 4 |
| 11 | _isUseSkillInfoPatternDescription | direct_15B | 15 |
| 12 | _elementalStatusInfo | reader_4B | 4 |
| 13 | _useCountingByGlobalTimer | direct_15B | 15 |

Crucially: **the schema does NOT define BuffData (the list element
type)**. _buffDataList is just a count u32; the actual list items
live somewhere outside what the engine schema describes. Existing
external parsers (``pabgb_field_parsers.py:parse_buff_record``,
line 144) use a HEURISTIC SCANNER, not a structured parser , just
grep-scanning the entry bytes for known stat hashes and rates.

That's why no public buffinfo editor has shipped: the BuffData
binary layout was undecoded.

### Sentinel 0x73e1c5ea is sub-structural, not item-bounding

Hypothesis tested: ``73 e1 c5 ea`` (= u32 0xEAC5E173) appearing
N times in an entry where ``_buffDataList`` count = N.
Result: 0/280 matches across the table , the sentinel appears
per-sub-field, not per-item. E.g. BuffLevel_Drunken has count=1
but 47 sentinels in 5222 bytes (~111 bytes between sentinels).

Probably a per-stat-effect marker that appears many times inside
each buff_data item's body. Not useful for finding item boundaries.

### Why progress stops here without an oracle

The `byN` raw-byte naming in Adfaz's mod paths
(``data.base.by58``, ``by69``, ``by132``) is the giveaway: even
Adfaz didn't decode the structure, they exposed bytes by raw
position. Their tool computes offsets from somewhere , probably
runtime introspection of a parsed buff_data, but we don't have
their parser.

To make verified progress on Phase 3+, we need ONE of:

1. **Adfaz's parser source** , one Nexus DM. Cheapest path.
2. **Adfaz's tool itself** as oracle: feed it a known input, observe
   which bytes change in the output, infer offsets.
3. **A weeks-long byte-walking RE project** using vanilla
   ``buffinfo.pabgb`` only, treating Adfaz's ``new`` values as
   weak oracles (they specify the value to write but not the offset
   to write at).

Shipping speculative offsets would corrupt user game files.
Stopping at Phase 2 is the right move until an oracle becomes
available.

## What's shipped (sessions 1-3)

| Phase | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| 1, 2 | Entry prefix: key, name, is_blocked, buff_data_count |
| 3a | Full BuffinfoEntry wrapper round-trips byte-perfectly across all 280 vanilla entries |
| 3b | BuffItemHeader decoder (5-byte preamble: prefix_id + absent_flag) |
| 3c | BuffPayloadCommon decoder: 28 fields including 1 cstring + 2 length-prefixed u32 arrays |

Public ``locate_buff_field`` paths that resolve today:
- All 10 wrapper fields (min_level, max_level, ui_*, *_status_info, etc.)
- ``buff_data_list[0].absent_flag``
- ``buff_data_list[0].leading_lookup``
- ``buff_data_list[0].data.base.<28 fields>``

## What's left (Phase 3d+)

Items at index > 0 still need a per-variant size lookup so the
parser can walk past each item to the next. The variant family is
120 variants wide. Vanilla buffinfo uses 39 distinct tags
(empirically scanned), with tag 17 covering 95/280 entries. Most
common tags by count: 17, 80, 3, 7, 63, 12, 104, 37, 106, 2, 95.

Variant tail also carries the ``data.variant.type`` and
``data.variant.body.f00 / f01`` paths the mod uses (3 leaves out of
31).

A practical approach, in priority order:

1. Build a per-tag size table by walking each entry forward through
   its items. Use vanilla as the oracle: an entry of count=N
   should have its items_region span exactly to min_level_offset.
   For entries where the first item's tail size is the only
   unknown (single-item entries), we can derive the tail size by
   subtraction. Repeat across single-item entries to gather one
   sample per variant tag observed.
2. Cross-check by walking N-item entries and confirming the
   table-derived sizes sum correctly.
3. Decode variant body fields ``type`` (first byte of tail) and
   ``f00 / f01`` (next two u32s).

Estimated effort: 1-2 sessions of careful walking + verification.

## How to resume

```bash
# 1. Extract a fresh copy of vanilla buffinfo.pabgb
py -3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from pathlib import Path
from cdumm.engine.json_patch_handler import (
    _find_pamt_entry, _extract_from_paz)
vanilla = Path(r'E:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Crimson Desert/CDMods/vanilla')
entry = _find_pamt_entry('buffinfo.pabgb', vanilla)
Path(r'C:/temp/buffinfo.pabgb').write_bytes(_extract_from_paz(entry))
"

# 2. Inspect single-item entries with known semantics
py -3 -c "
from pycrimson._files import BinaryGameBlob
from cdumm._vendor.buffinfo_parser import parse_entry_prefix
from pathlib import Path
b = BinaryGameBlob.from_file(Path(r'C:/temp/buffinfo.pabgb'))
for off, payload in list(b.entries.items())[:5]:
    h = parse_entry_prefix(payload)
    print(h)
    print(payload[h.body_start:h.body_start+80].hex())
"

# 3. Run Adfaz's mod on a controlled scratch buffinfo with verbose
#    logging so you can observe which exact bytes change , gives
#    you the field-to-offset mapping for free without speculation.
```
